/// My Laptop: Acer Aspire 5250 \\\

CPU: AMD-E300 1.3 Ghz 2 cores
GPU: AMD Radeon HD6310

Display: TN 1366x768

My opinion about my laptop: Can be good enough for basic things as browsing, YouTube (only 360p), and even simple coding without heavy GUI. Sometimes I edit photos in GIMP, it works not too bad. Can run LibreOffice without any issues. Some people bought him for my family in 2012, and I use him since I was very small. I got him as my own laptop in 2021 year.

I would like to buy a better laptop (probably used Lenovo) for my coding hobbie, maybe something with a Intel Core i5 2-3 gen processor and 8GB of RAM, but for now I don't have enough money for it.

/// My coding skills \\\

I like to write codes, and that's one of my the most favorite hobbies. I like to write on C++, html + css (web at all), and sometimes C. I was trying to write codes on Python, but for me he was too limited and easy.

I'm a begginer in coding, but I just like to do it for my needs.

/// About me \\\
